This project was created as a solution at russian hackathon Cup IT 2022 (https://changellenge.com/championships/changellenge-cup-it-2022/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=segment&amp;utm_campaign=auto-partials). 
Currently this folder includes pdf and ipynb format files. The project is written in python with russian comments.

This project is an analysis of sales of non-food russian retail shop and share of P&G brand presented in this shop. 
The datasets given for an analysis are 1. 'purchases' data (with every single check for one year if this check includes at least one P&G product) and 2. 'customers' data (sex,age, etc) 

Tasks:
1. Process data and examine the dataset for trends and patterns.
2. Create a cross-selling matrix for non-food categories in "Magnit Cosmetic" shop and understand how to increase sales growth for P&G products.
3. Based on the analysis of data and the relationship of goods in the cross-sales matrix, draw conclusions and give recommendations for increasing sales. 


General conclusions: 
1. The gender and age composition of customers who have at least one P&G product on their receipt does not differ from the general gender and age composition of the store customers
"Magnet Cosmetics. We can also note that the absolute numerical expression of those who buy P&G is not significantly different from the total number of registered in the magnet. This means that an overwhelming number of shoppers registered with Magnet Cosmetics buy or have bought P&G products.
2. Customers who bought more than 3 P&G products in one check more than 8 times a year bought the same products as customers who made one purchase and never went back to the store: Toilet paper, Household cleaning products, Toothpaste, Wet cat and kitten food, Shampoo. These numbers are virtually the same as the average Magnet store customer. 
3. To increase sales, it is recommended to put relatively side by side on the shelves:
a) wet and dry animal's food, eatable treats  
b) paper towels/wipes and toilet paper 
c) household cleaning products and toilet paper

The cross-sell analysis part of the project would be impossible without this material from Eser SaygÄ±n: https://towardsdatascience.com/affinity-analysis-market-basket-analysis-c8e7fcc61a21
