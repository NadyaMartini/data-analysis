This project is an analysis of sales of non-food russian retail shop and share of P&G brand presented in this shop. 
The datasets given for an analysis are 1. 'purchases' data (with every single check for one year if this check includes at least one P&G product) and 2. 'customers' data (sex,age, etc) 

Tasks:
1. Process data and examine the dataset for trends and patterns.
2. Create a cross-selling matrix for non-food categories in "Magnit Cosmetic" shop and understand how to increase sales growth for P&G products.
3. Based on the analysis of data and the relationship of goods in the cross-sales matrix, draw conclusions and give recommendations for increasing sales. 

The cross-sell analysis part of the project would be impossible without this source: (https://towardsdatascience.com/affinity-analysis-market-basket-analysis-c8e7fcc61a21).
