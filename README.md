This project is an analysis of sales of non-food russian retail shop and share of P&G brand presented in this shop. 
The datasets given for an analysis are 1. 'purchases' data (with every single check for one year if this check includes at least one P&G product) and 2. 'customers' data (sex,age, etc) 

Tasks:
1. Process data and examine the dataset for trends and patterns.
2. Create a cross-selling matrix for non-food categories in "Magnit Cosmetic" shop and understand how to increase sales growth for P&G products.
3. Based on the analysis of data and the relationship of goods in the cross-sales matrix, draw conclusions and give recommendations for increasing sales. 


General conclusions: 
1. The gender and age composition of customers who have at least one P&G product on their receipt does not differ from the general gender and age composition of the customers of "Magnet Cosmetics". We can also note that the absolute numerical expression of those who buy P&G is not significantly different from the total number of registered in the magnet. This means that an overwhelming number of shoppers, who buys P&G products, are registered in "Magnet Cosmetics" as regular clients. 
2. Customers who has more than 3 P&G products in one receipt more than 8 times a year usually are buying the same products as customers who made one purchase and never went back to the store: Toilet paper, Household cleaning products, Toothpaste, Wet cat and kitten food, Shampoo. And this preferences of goods for "P&G" buyers are almost the same as for the average "Magnet Cosmetic" store customer. 
3. To increase sales, we recommend to put relatively side by side on the shelves:
a) wet and dry animal's food, eatable treats  
b) paper towels/wipes and toilet paper 
c) household cleaning products and toilet paper
