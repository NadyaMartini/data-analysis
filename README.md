This project was created as a solution at russian hackathon Cup IT 2022 (https://changellenge.com/championships/changellenge-cup-it-2022/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=segment&amp;utm_campaign=auto-partials). 
Currently this folder includes pdf and html format files. The project is written in python with russian comments. Planning on translating it into english. 

This project is an analysis of sales of non-food russian retail shop and share of P&G brand presented in this shop. 
The datasets given for an analysis are 1. 'purchases' data (with every single check for one year if this check includes at least one P&G product) and 2. 'customers' data (sex,age, etc) 

The cross-sell analysis part of the project would be impossible without this source (https://towardsdatascience.com/affinity-analysis-market-basket-analysis-c8e7fcc61a21).
